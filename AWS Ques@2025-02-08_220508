Here are some AWS interview questions tailored for candidates with around **4 years of experience**. These questions cover a range of topics including core AWS 
services, architecture design, troubleshooting, security, and best practices.

### 1. **General AWS Knowledge**
- **What are the differences between EC2 and Lambda? When would you choose one over the other?**
When to Use EC2
Use EC2 when you need:

✅ Full control over the operating system and environment
✅ Long-running applications or background workers
✅ Custom software installs or special dependencies
✅ Applications with stateful behavior
✅ Traditional server hosting, e.g., web apps, databases, batch jobs

⚡ When to Use Lambda
Use Lambda when you need:

✅ Event-driven execution (S3 upload, DynamoDB stream, API Gateway, etc.)
✅ Short-lived, stateless functions
✅ Rapid scaling based on concurrent requests
✅ Lower cost for infrequent workloads
✅ Minimal infrastructure management (just deploy code)

- **What are some ways to secure your AWS account?**

- **What are the different types of storage options in AWS, and when would you use each?**
  - (e.g., EBS, S3, Glacier, EFS, etc.)
- **Explain the concept of Availability Zones and Regions in AWS. Why are they important?**
- **What are the key differences between an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and a Network Load Balancer (NLB)?**
- **What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of using Spot Instances in AWS?**
  | Advantage                | Disadvantage                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Very low cost            | Can be interrupted anytime     |
| Access to extra capacity | No guaranteed availability     |
|You can run high-volume workloads at a low cost | Your app needs to be fault-tolerant and able to resume or retry if a Spot instance disappears.
| Great for stateless apps | Requires fault-tolerant design |

### 2. **Compute and Networking**
- **What is an Auto Scaling Group, and how does it work?**
1. Vertical Scaling (Scale Up/Down)
Increase/decrease the instance type (e.g., t3.medium → m5.large)

Simple but involves downtime (you must stop and restart the instance)

 2. Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out/In)
Add more EC2 instances behind a load balancer

Automatically scale in/out based on load (e.g., CPU, memory, requests/sec)

🔸 This is highly available and fault-tolerant — preferred for production.

- **What is the difference between an Elastic IP and a Public IP?**
An Elastic Load Balancer automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses in one or more Availability Zones.
- **How would you set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS and ensure security and best practices?**
  - (e.g., Subnets, Route Tables, NACLs, Security Groups)
- **What are the differences between an Internet Gateway and a Virtual Private Gateway in AWS?**

Feature	Internet Gateway (IGW)	                                                         Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)
Purpose	Provides a connection between a VPC and the internet. Provides a connection between a VPC and an on-premises network or another VPC (via VPN or Direct Connect).
Connection Type	Connects a VPC to the public internet.	        Connects a VPC to a private network (on-premises or another VPC).

### 3. **Security and Identity**
- **How do you implement Identity and Access Management (IAM) in AWS?**
  - (e.g., Users, Groups, Roles, Policies)
- **What are IAM best practices to follow?**
- **Explain the concept of IAM roles for EC2 instances.**
- **What are Security Groups, and how do they differ from Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)?**
- **How would you secure an S3 bucket to prevent public access?**

Enable Block Public Access: Use the S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent any public access to your bucket and objects.
Review Bucket Policy: Ensure your bucket policy denies public access and allows access only to authorized users.
Review Object ACLs: Make sure that the objects in the bucket are not publicly accessible through ACLs.
Be Cautious with Pre-signed URLs: Use them only when necessary, and ensure they are temporary and secure.
Carefully Manage IAM Permissions: Ensure IAM users, groups, and roles have appropriate permissions to access the bucket.
Use Encryption: Enable encryption to secure your objects at rest.
Monitor and Audit Access: Use CloudTrail, S3 access logs, and AWS Config to monitor and detect unauthorized access or configuration changes.

- **Explain AWS Key Management Service (KMS). How would you use it to encrypt data?**
AWS KMS is a fully managed service that helps you create, control, and manage encryption keys used to protect your data.

🎯 Key Features:
Centralized management of encryption keys

Integrated with most AWS services

Supports encryption at rest and encryption in transit

- **How would you set up multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your AWS account?**

### 4. **Storage and Databases**
- **Explain the different types of Amazon S3 storage classes and use cases for each.**
- **What is Amazon EBS, and what types of volumes are available?**
Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) is a block storage service designed for use with Amazon EC2 instances.
It provides durable, high-performance, persistent storage that you can attach to EC2.
EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices (like virtual hard disks).
They persist independently from the EC2 instance lifecycle.
| Feature            | EBS                                     | Instance Store                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Persistence**    | Yes – data survives instance stop/start | No – data lost when instance stops |
| **Backup support** | Snapshots supported                     | Not supported                      |
| **Durability**     | Highly durable (replicated in AZ)       | Temporary                          |
