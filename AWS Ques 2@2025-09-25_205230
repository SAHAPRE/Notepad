# 🚀 AWS Interview Q\&A Cheat Sheet (4 Years Experience)

---

## 🔹 **EC2**

**Q1. Difference between On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot Instances?**

* **On-Demand** → pay as you go, flexible, no commitment.
* **Reserved** → 1/3 year commitment, cheaper, good for steady workloads.
* **Spot** → unused capacity, very cheap, but can be terminated anytime.
| Feature     | On-Demand            | Reserved                    | Spot                               |
| ----------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Pricing     | Highest              | Medium (up to 72% off)      | Lowest (up to 90% off)             |
| Commitment  | None                 | 1–3 years                   | None                               |
| Reliability | High                 | High                        | Low (can be interrupted)           |
| Best For    | Short-term, dev/test | Long-term, steady workloads | Fault-tolerant, flexible workloads |


**Q2. If an Auto Scaling EC2 fails health check, what happens?**

* ASG will terminate it and launch a replacement automatically.

---

## 🔹 **VPC & Networking**

**Q3. Difference between Security Groups and NACLs?**

* **Security Group** → stateful, instance-level, allows rules only.
* **NACL** → stateless, subnet-level, allows & denies rules.

**Q4. NAT Gateway vs Internet Gateway?**

* **IGW** → provides internet access to **public subnets**.
* **NAT Gateway** → allows **private subnets** to reach internet (for updates, downloads) but blocks inbound traffic.

---

## 🔹 **Storage**

**Q5. Difference between S3, EBS, and EFS?**

* **S3** → object storage, unlimited, used for backups/data lake.
* **EBS** → block storage, attached to single EC2, persistent.
* **EFS** → shared file storage, multiple EC2s can mount.

**Q6. How do you secure an S3 bucket for VPC-only access?**

* Use **VPC Endpoint + Bucket Policy** to allow access only from that VPC.

---

## 🔹 **Load Balancing & Scaling**

**Q7. Difference between ALB, NLB, and CLB?**

* **ALB** → Layer 7, HTTP/HTTPS, supports routing rules.
* **NLB** → Layer 4, TCP/UDP, ultra-low latency, millions of req/sec.
* **CLB** → Legacy, supports basic Layer 4/7, not recommended.

**Q8. How to configure SSL on ALB?**

* Create/Import cert in **ACM**, attach it to ALB listener (HTTPS:443).

---

## 🔹 **Databases**

**Q9. Multi-AZ vs Read Replica in RDS?**

* **Multi-AZ** → HA, synchronous replication, failover support.
* **Read Replica** → scalability, async replication, used for reads.

**Q10. DynamoDB vs RDS?**

* **DynamoDB** → NoSQL, key-value, serverless, scales automatically.
* **RDS** → SQL, relational, managed but not serverless.

---

## 🔹 **IAM & Security**

**Q11. IAM Role vs User?**

* **User** → permanent identity for humans/apps.
* **Role** → temporary credentials, assumed by users/services.

**Q12. What is STS AssumeRole?**

* Used for temporary access (cross-account access or limited-time privilege).

---

## 🔹 **Monitoring & Ops**

**Q13. Difference between CloudWatch Logs, Metrics, and Alarms?**

* **Logs** → raw event logs (EC2, Lambda).
* **Metrics** → numeric time-series (CPU, memory).
* **Alarms** → trigger actions based on metric thresholds.

**Q14. How would you troubleshoot an EC2 not connecting to internet?**

* Check: SG, NACL, Route Table, Subnet (public/private), NAT/IGW, DNS settings.

---

## 🔹 **Scenario-Based**

**Q15. Your ALB latency is high, how do you troubleshoot?**

* Check target health (unhealthy targets slow response).
* Review scaling policy (not enough instances).
* Analyze CloudWatch metrics (5xx errors, latency trends).
* Look into app-level bottlenecks.

**Q16. S3 bucket is public but file still not accessible. Why?**

* Block Public Access enabled.
* Missing bucket policy or object ACL.
* Signed URL requirement.

**Q17. RDS failover happened but app still failing to connect. Why?**

* App using IP instead of endpoint (DNS not updated).
* DNS caching at app layer.
* Failover taking longer than expected.

---

## 🔹 **Cost Optimization**

**Q18. How do you reduce EC2 costs?**

* Use **Reserved Instances/Savings Plans** for steady workloads.
* Use **Spot Instances** for fault-tolerant workloads.
* Rightsize instances (CloudWatch + Trusted Advisor).
* Turn off unused resources.

**Q19. Savings Plans vs Reserved Instances?**

* **Savings Plans** → flexible (apply to any instance family/region).
* **Reserved Instances** → tied to specific type/region but may save more.

---

## 🔹 **Advanced**

**Q20. Difference between SQS Standard and FIFO queues?**

* **Standard** → unlimited throughput, at-least-once delivery, unordered.
* **FIFO** → ordered, exactly-once processing, limited throughput.

**Q21. Route 53 Routing Policies?**

* **Simple** → single record.
* **Weighted** → split traffic (e.g., 70%-30%).
* **Failover** → active/passive setup.
* **Geolocation** → based on user location.
