EBS is a storage volume where we add disk store data in create filesystem to store data in a define size.. disk need to mount to VM
we can resize the data according to the defined size of the disk. It can be attached and detached to the VM
EFS- SAME AS EBS but can be connect to multiple ec2 instances. You do not need to tell it to create a file system of hundreds or 200 GBS.
You simply create an ifsc and it grows and shrinks as you add or delete files.
