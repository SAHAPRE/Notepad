What is swap and when is it used? - Yes — much slower than RAM, because it's on disk.
Using swap excessively leads to high disk I/O and slow performance — this is called swapping. Swap is a type of disk space that your Linux system uses as virtual memory when RAM is full.
Situation	              What Happens
RAM is sufficient	    Swap is not used
RAM is getting full 	Linux starts to use swap for less-used pages
RAM is completely used	Swap prevents crashes (but slows down system)
