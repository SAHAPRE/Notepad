GIT COMMANDS:
git config, git init, git clone, git add, git commit, git diff, git reset, git status, git rm, git log, git show, git tag, git branch, git checkout, git merge, 
gitremote, git push, git pull, git stash

git rebase - it clean the commit history.
it will merge with branch feature1 ahead of feature 2 ---> also delete the file(it will delete if we will use -i option)
and no extra commit id will generate on merginghb

git rebase -i and that commit id before that all history will get clear.
Git rebase is used for integrating changes from one branch onto another
 
 on branch master, we will apply git rebase new(branch name)

Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit

git clone does soon, but for now just know that it downloads the project from remote and places it in a folder in your current working directory.

Git is telling us that our branch is "up to date" with something called origin/main.

origin is a new concept known as a remote. A remote is a "remote source" different from your local machine.

Git remote - This command lists all of our remotes. From the result we can see that we have a remote named origin, and the Git URL of this remote 
points to our repo on Github.com. This remote was automatically setup for us when we ran git clone.

$$$$$$ Git Remote is use to add a reference of remote source code mangaement to your local repository.
git remote -v --- This shows the list of remotes configured for the repository. 
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
This command links your local repository to a remote repository.


This string of characters and numbers is called the SHA—it's the unique ID generated by a hashing algorithm for this commit.

we use the git push command and we can specify where we want to push and what branch we want to push to.
#git push origin main -- git push  (destination) source

If we look back at the git log output we'll notice that both our local and origin point to the same commit now:

In short, on origin (GitHub) the main branch (also written as origin/main) has now placed our new commit as the latest commit in the history.

This is the real power of Git after all: a system to collaborate and track changes over time amongst many collaborators.

Git fetch - it pull the changes done in remote. 
we can clone the chnages in our local only for once,again if we want any changes we need to do git fetch to pull the changes that has been done in 
remote.
git pull - it pulls the changes done in remote and also get merge in featured branch.

git stash - will behave as draft
git stash temporarily saves changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else,and then come back and re-apply them later on.

 2071  git tag
 2072  git show
 2073  git log --oneline
 2074  git checkout abc81d0
 2075  git branch

We name a particular commit id by giving it tag so that in future it will be easy for us to checrry pick those tag directly to our branch

You can cherry-pick a commit on one branch to create a copy of the commit with the same changes on another branch. If you commit changes
 to the wrong branch or want to make the same changes to another branch, you can cherry-pick the commit to apply the changes to another branch.

2107  git log --oneline
 2108  git cherry-pick 0d6bb7b
 2109  git cherry-pick b08eac0
 2110  git status
 2111  nano file
 2112  git add .

$$$$$ Git cherry pick ---   It allows you to "pick" a commit from another branch and apply it to your current branch, without merging the entire branch
