## 🧪 MOCK INTERVIEW Q\&A — DEVOPS ENGINEER (3.5 YRS)

---

### ✅ **Q1. Tell me about your current project and your role.**

**Answer:**
I'm currently working on a microservices-based application deployed on AWS EKS. My role involves setting up and maintaining CI/CD pipelines using 
Jenkins, containerizing applications with Docker, deploying using Helm charts to Kubernetes, and ensuring monitoring/logging using Prometheus and 
Grafana. I also manage secrets using AWS Secrets Manager and store artifacts in Nexus.

---
### ✅ **Q2. How is your Jenkins pipeline structured?**

**Answer:**
We use a declarative pipeline with multiple stages:

* **Build**: Node.js/Maven build
* **Test**: Unit tests, linting
* **Code Quality**: SonarQube scan
* **Docker**: Image build and push to ECR
* **Deploy**: Helm deployment to EKS

We use multi-branch pipelines with separate stages for `develop`, `release`, and `main` branches.

---

### ✅ **Q3. How do you implement rollback in Jenkins?**

**Answer:**
We store all build artifacts and Docker images with version tags. For rollback:

* We identify the last successful build using Jenkins API or job history
* Retrieve the corresponding artifact or image from Nexus/ECR
* Redeploy it using Helm with the specific image tag

We also use `helm rollback` for EKS deployments when needed.

### ✅ **Q4. How do you manage secrets securely in your pipeline?**

**Answer:**
We use **AWS Secrets Manager** to store sensitive credentials. Jenkins pulls secrets via `withCredentials` block or through secure environment variables. In Kubernetes, secrets are mounted as volumes or environment variables with access controlled via RBAC.

---

### ✅ **Q5. What is the difference between ConfigMap and Secret in Kubernetes?**

**Answer:**

* **ConfigMap** stores non-sensitive configuration data (e.g., log level, URLs)
* **Secret** stores sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys)
  Both can be mounted as volumes or exposed as environment variables. Secrets are base64-encoded and encrypted at rest with KMS.

---

### ✅ **Q6. A pod is in `CrashLoopBackOff`. How do you troubleshoot?**

**Answer:**

* Check logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name>`
* Describe pod: `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`
* Validate readiness/liveness probes
* Check resource limits (`OOMKilled`)
* Review Docker image, command overrides, and missing config/env

---

### ✅ **Q7. What is the purpose of using Helm in your deployments?**

**Answer:**
Helm simplifies Kubernetes deployments by using charts (templated YAML files). It allows us to:

* Version control deployments
* Reuse templates across environments
* Use values.yaml for environment-specific config
* Rollback and upgrade easily using `helm upgrade` or `helm rollback`

---

### ✅ **Q8. How do you ensure high availability of your application in Kubernetes?**

**Answer:**

* Use **multiple replicas** across nodes
* Set proper **resource requests and limits**
* Configure **readiness/liveness probes**
* Use **PodDisruptionBudgets** for graceful rolling updates
* Spread across **availability zones** using node selectors or affinity

---

### ✅ **Q9. Explain a challenging incident you resolved.**

**Answer:**
During a release, the application started throwing 500 errors. Logs showed DB connection failures. After investigation, we found the secrets had rotated but the app wasn't reloaded. 
We updated the Helm chart to trigger rollout on secret change and added alerting on secret mismatches.

---

### ✅ **Q10. What is your branching strategy?**

**Answer:**
We follow **Gitflow**:

* `main`: Production-ready code
* `develop`: Integration branch
* `feature/*`: New features
* `release/*`: Pre-release staging
* `hotfix/*`: Quick patches

Each branch has separate Jenkins pipelines with different deployment targets.

## 💡 BONUS QUESTIONS (Rapid Fire)

* **Command to scale a deployment in K8s:**
  `kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=5`

* **How to check last 50 lines of pod logs:**
  `kubectl logs my-pod --tail=50`

* **Dockerfile best practices?**
  Use small base image (e.g., Alpine), multi-stage builds, `.dockerignore`, no hardcoded secrets.

* **Difference between EBS and EFS:**
  EBS is block storage for one EC2; EFS is shared file system for multiple EC2s.
