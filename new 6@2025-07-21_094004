✅ Sample Answer: Why I Prefer Docker in My Project
I prefer Docker in my projects primarily because it brings consistency, portability, and scalability to our microservices-based architecture.

In our project, we had multiple microservices built using different stacks — like Node.js, Python, and Java — and each had its own dependencies and runtime 
requirements. Docker helped us encapsulate each service in its own container along with all its dependencies, ensuring that it runs exactly the same across 
development, staging, and production.

We also used Docker as part of our CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins, where each service is built into a Docker image, scanned with SonarQube, tested, and then pushed to 
Nexus. These images are then deployed into our Kubernetes cluster via Helm charts.

Docker made it very easy for new developers to onboard — they just had to run docker-compose up and all services were up and running locally. Plus, since containers 
are lightweight, we could spin them up and tear them down quickly for automated integration testing.

Finally, Docker’s integration with monitoring and orchestration tools like Prometheus and Kubernetes made it ideal for production workloads, giving us full control
over scaling and resource limits.
