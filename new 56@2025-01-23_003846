In Ansible, the register keyword is used to capture the output of a task and store it in a variable, which can then be used in subsequent
 tasks within the playbook. This is useful for handling results or conditions dynamically based on the execution of tasks.

 the playbook are executed. This information can include facts such as the operating system, IP addresses, hardware details, memory, and 
 other system properties.
 
3. how to store variable in vars.yaml file?
 user_details:
  name: webuser
  group: webgroup
  home: /home/webuser
  
  at the time of execution, inside the playbook - variable block, in inventory- /etc/ansible/hosts- beside ip, vars.yaml file

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml -e "variable1=value1 variable2=value2"

4.synchronize module- The synchronize module in Ansible is used to efficiently copy files or directories between remote machines or between
 the local machine and a remote machine. It is a wrapper around the rsync command, providing an easy-to-use interface for performing file
 synchronization tasks.

This module is particularly useful for large files or directories where you want to avoid copying everything each time; it only transfers 
changes (new or modified files), making it more efficient than traditional file copy methods like copy or fetch.
