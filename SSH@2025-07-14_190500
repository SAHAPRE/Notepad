scp is not getting connected, what can be reason:

1.ssh port is not open
2.permissions has not been given to the user (in case i don't have overall permission, only read is there)
3.hostname is not correct
4.ip is not correct ,path is wrong, 
5.server is down
6.need to check with ping

 1995  pwd
 1996  telnet 10.0.0.9 22
 1997  ping 10.0.0.9
 1998  ls
 1999  curl ifconfig.me=
 2000  ifconfig

  ssh connection:
  
  first will check ssh is installed in  remote server or not
  if not, will installed
  will check status from sshd
  and after that if we want to do passwordless login then will first generate the keys from ssh-keygen
  after generation of keys, we will keep the private keys with ourselves and share the public keys to the users whose server we wish to connect. 
  once, they install the public keys on their side, we can connect them using private keys.
  
  remote server me authorized keys k ander public key copy karte hai.
  
  ssh connectivity:\\

we can install ssh
systemctl status ssh
port is open or not by telnet command
we will check firewall is open or not in remote server using telnet


The du (disk usage) command measures the disk space occupied by files or directories.
 By default, it measures the current directory and all its subdirectories, printing totals in blocks for each, with a grand total at the bottom.
 
 
 df -kh ->
  The df command displays the amount of disk space available on the filesystem with each file name's argument.
